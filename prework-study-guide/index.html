          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git log: show all commits in the current branch's history</li>
          <li>git branch: list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
