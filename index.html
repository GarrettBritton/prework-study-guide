        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>You only want to use one "H1" header per page.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
          <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The "ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The "img" element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The "br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the "a" element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "link"element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>the "meta" element defines the charset, or character set, as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git log: show all commits in the current branch's history</li>
          <li>git branch: list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <li>the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
            <li>"let" allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
            <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
